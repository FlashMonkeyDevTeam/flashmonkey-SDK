# FlashMonkey-CardType-SDK

This is the FlashMonkey Inc. Education Platform SDK (Software Development Kit). Developers use this repo to download, develop, and test their CardTypes for the FlashMonkey Platform.

# FlashMonkey Short Explanation

FlashMonkey is a multi-sided marketplace for learning materials, learning courses, and software learning types known as CardTypes or TestTypes. We have developed the majority of the platform to include our payment system. Our users can create, study, and sell learning materials. Learning materials are more than notes. although notes can be used, they are great for information, but not for memorialization nor self testing. FlashMonkey defines learning separately from the consumption of reading materials. Learning includes memorialization since learning cannot occur without memorialization. The Platform allows for creative genius by developers and compensates them for what they create. The FlashMonkey Platform includes a mature learning, distribution, and payment system. Our architecture is well proven and stable and future releases will support earning or allow time for earners to update their materials.

# Justification

The incumbent Learning platforms to date are cumbersome and limited. They are albatrosses that are difficult to organize and difficult to use. Some other major platforms are essentially used by students for cheating. And still others reward users with very limited compensation for the effort the users contribute - Literally pennies for their effort. This compensation model results in poor and inaccurate data that costs those companies their reputations and their bottom line.  In comparison our platform places learning as a first class citizen and prioritizes our users above our profits. Our platform makes creating learning materials very easy and very fast. Our compensation model gives our users all of their asking price, minus only minor credit card fees. In addition to this, we encourage accuracy of learning materials by allowing consumers, those who buy others learning materials, to earn when they edit and redistribute those learning materials. We've built in capabilities that protect the original creators learning materials and several other innovations in data science that makes this a really cool platform.

# Learning for remote and harsh regions of our world

We built FlashMonkey for everyone. Even those who live in harsh conditions with little access to the internet. Having travelled and lived in some of the most hostile and remote regions, we believe individual security is built through knowledge. For this reason, FlashMonkey is a powerful native application that may be used with no access to the internet and thus reach learners everywhere. This was a prerequisite for FlashMonkey and gives isolated populations an opportunity to receive a first class education.

# Download

FlashMonkey may be downloaded for Windows and for Mac platforms from our website. https://FlashMonkey.co

# Misc

We may or may not distribute FlashMonkey on Mobile Devices. And we may or may not be in Windows and Apple App Stores.
Our current system works very well on Windows.

# Developers License and Compensation Agreement

In the FlashMonkey Multi-Sided Marketplace, software developers are compensated for their works and the usage of their work. We are developing our license and compensation agreement. In its current state, it reads as follows:

// ----------------------------------------------------- LICENSE and AGREEMENT -------------------------------------------------------//

**This is a Fair Developer and Fair Use License and Compensation Agreement:**


FlashMonkey's core software and some test-types, not including libraries, is covered by multiple pending patents. The core software is Copyright (c) 2020-2023 FlashMonkey Inc., Lowell Stadelman. The software in the SDK software package is copyright protected but may be freely used for development works and for individual usage by developers.

Definitions:
- Any reference to FlashMonkey means FlashMonkey Inc.
- Any reference to this license is for "this software" which is limited to the the body of this work. This work does not include any third-party libraries that have their own licenses.

Intent:
FlashMonkey, and future versions, are intended to be used in a learning ecosystem where users are both recognized for their works, and may be compensated for what they have authored. FlashMonkey's ecosystem allows original-creators to sell thier works for monetary compensation in an open or a limited market. FlashMonkey's current business model is not specified since this is a moving target, but it is the intent that creators and editors are fairly compensated for their works.

The intent of the Fair Developer and Fair Use License is to give authors recognition for their contributions and allow early open development with a stipulation that an author is recognized and compensated for their works. A class created by an author is generally copyright protected under this license. This license further specifies conditions for its future distribution if it is distributed, by rewarding authors for their contributions. That the authors works would be provided with a distribution or as a stand-alone test type/ card type that may be licensed from a marketplace. If sold or licensed in a marketplace, you agree that FlashMonkey may upload it into an experimental marketplace and set a price for it until all mechanisms for a marketplace are in place. In another scenario, FlashMonkey may be branded under a third party e.g. a learning institutions name. If your card type is included in the distribution, your monetary compensation is by the value of its contribution e.g. if your card type or types are the only types included in the software distribution, then your monetary compensation is not more than 32% of the earnings after taxes, and costs. E.g. if an institution uses FlashMonkey's software and your card types are used to teach calculus, and they are the only card-types included, then you would be compensated 32% of the net earnings from the contract. If they are a share of card types, then compensation would be according to their usage. In this scenario. The number of total card types included in the software distribution is irrelevant. If the software distribution included 10 card types, and your card types are 3 of the 10 or only 1 out of the 10, but your card-types were 64% of the sets used. Then your monetary compensation would be according to your card-type's usage. E.g. if your 3 card-types are 64% of the card-types used in users decks, then you would receive 64% of the 32%.
